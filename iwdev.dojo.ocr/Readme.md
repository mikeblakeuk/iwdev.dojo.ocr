The session didn't go well because the unit test didn't contain new lines (wrong tests)!
It also took us too long to get the logic right.

This version doesn't convert the 'blocks' to characters or read the file but that should be the easy bit
===
Wednesday night I started again using the spec and including lines.
It was also easy to add the ? feature if the block could not be found.

Thursday I added the mod validation and removed the Tuesday night rubbish stuff.
